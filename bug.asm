mov eax, [ebx + ecx*4 + 0x10]

This instruction attempts to access memory at an address calculated as the sum of the value in EBX, four times the value in ECX, and 0x10.  The problem is that it assumes that ECX is already properly scaled for the size of the data being accessed. If the data at the target memory location is not a 4-byte integer, this will lead to incorrect results or crashes.

For example, if you intended to access an array of bytes, the offset calculation should not multiply ECX by 4. If the array is composed of words (2 bytes), it should multiply ECX by 2.  Incorrect scaling causes the program to read or write the wrong memory locations.
